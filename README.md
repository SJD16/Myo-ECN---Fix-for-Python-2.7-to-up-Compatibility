# Myo-ECN---Fix-for-Python-2.7-to-up-Compatibility

This repository contains a fix for the streaming.py example from the smetanadvorak/myo_ecn repository. The issue arises due to a deprecated syntax in newer versions of Python (2.7 and above) in the MultichannelPlot.py file.

##Issue Description
The streaming.py script uses a MultichannelPlot class for visualizing EMG data from the MYO armband. However, the following line in MultichannelPlot.py causes an error in Python 2.7 and above:
```bash
self.axes = [self.fig.add_subplot(str(self.nchan) + '1' + str(i+1)) for i in range(self.nchan)]
```
I belive this line uses an outdated syntax for creating subplots in Matplotlib, which is no longer supported in newer versions of Python.

##Fix
To resolve this issue, replace the problematic line in MultichannelPlot.py with the following updated syntax:

```bash
self.axes = [self.fig.add_subplot((self.nchan), 1, i) for i in range(1, (self.nchan))]
```
This change ensures compatibility with newer versions of Python and Matplotlib.
## Steps to Apply the Fix
 ### 1. Locate the MultichannelPlot.py file in the repository.
 ### 2. Open the file and find the following line (around line 11 or 12):
```bash
  self.axes = [self.fig.add_subplot(str(self.nchan) + '1' + str(i+1)) for i in range(self.nchan)]
```
 ### 3. Replace the line with the updated syntax:
 ```bash
 self.axes = [self.fig.add_subplot((self.nchan), 1, i) for i in range(1, (self.nchan))]
```
 ### 4. Save the file and re-run the streaming.py script.
 
 ## Download Fixed File
 If you donâ€™t want to manually edit the file, you can download the fixed MultichannelPlot.py from this repository. Simply replace the original file with the one provided here.

 ## Example Usage
 After applying the fix, you can run the streaming.py script without issues:
  ```bash
# Setup multichannel plotter for visualization:
plotter = MultichannelPlot(nchan=8, xlen=512)  # Number of EMG channels in MYO armband is 8
```
This will now work correctly in Python 2.7 and above.
